For years I was a member of a philosophical-minded, freethinking student society in Ghent, called "T.S.G. 't Zal Wel Gaan" ("T.S.G." stands for "taalminnend studentengenootschap" or language-loving student society). It's, as far as I know, the oldest of its kind in Belgium, founded in 1852. It has a long and turbulent history, but that's a story for another time.

During a few years I was a member, I did the visual side of operations, designing the posters mainly. Here I'm sharing a few that I've managed not to lose.

**Memorial lecture for Koen Raes** One of the very first posters I made; it was an adaption of the existing visual style.

**Alicja Gescinska on Catholic sexual morality**  I redesigned our visual style to be easily adaptable; based upon the ideas of Jan Tschichold.

**Evening on ecology and sustainable growth** The new style was flexible; changing colours didn't make it unrecognizable.

**Essay contest** One of the last designs I did. I kept it typographical, in theme with the subject. The design was a success: the winning essay was written by someone who found out about the contest through this poster.
